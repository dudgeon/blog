summary: "First post. Why I'm starting a blog, and what to expect."
---

This is the inaugural post on my new blog. I've been meaning to start writing publicly for a while, and I finally got around to setting up the infrastructure.

## What to Expect

I plan to write about:

- **Building with AI** — practical lessons from shipping AI-powered products and tools
- **Product management** — how the craft is evolving in the age of AI agents
- **Making things** — woodworking, side projects, and the joy of building
- **Writing itself** — using writing as a tool for thinking

No set cadence. I'll post when I have something worth sharing.

## The Setup

This blog runs on [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) with the [PaperMod](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod) theme, hosted on GitHub Pages. Posts are written in markdown and synced from a private repo. There's also a mirror on [Mataroa](https://mataroa.blog/) for anyone who prefers a minimal reading experience.

More on the technical setup in a future post, maybe.

For now: hello, world.
